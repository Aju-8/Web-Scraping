<h2>Web Scraping Project</h2>
This project focuses on web scraping, which involves extracting data from websites. The goal of this project is to gather valuable information from websites and store it for analysis or further processing. The scraped data can be used for various purposes, such as research, data analysis, or building machine learning models.

<h2>Overview</h2>
Web scraping is the process of automatically retrieving data from websites by sending HTTP requests and parsing the HTML content. In this project, we utilized various Python libraries, such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, to scrape data from target websites. The extracted data was then stored in a structured format for further analysis.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset for this project is obtained by scraping multiple websites. Each website contains specific information related to the desired data. The data can be in the form of text, tables, images, or other media types, depending on the website's content. It is essential to comply with the terms of service of the websites being scraped and respect their policies.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
The web scraping process typically involves the following steps:

Identifying the Target: Determine the websites from which data needs to be scraped. Define the specific pages or sections within the websites that contain the desired information.

Sending HTTP Requests: Use the Requests library to send HTTP GET requests to the target URLs and retrieve the HTML content of the web pages.

Parsing HTML: Utilize the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content and extract the relevant data using various methods such as searching for specific HTML tags, attributes, or CSS selectors.

Data Extraction: Extract the desired data from the parsed HTML content and transform it into a structured format, such as a Pandas DataFrame or JSON.

Data Storage: Store the extracted data in a suitable format, such as CSV, Excel, or a database, for further analysis or integration into other applications.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In conclusion, this project focused on web scraping as a means of extracting data from websites. By utilizing Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests, we successfully retrieved data from multiple websites. The extracted data can be used for various purposes, including research, analysis, or building machine learning models.
